The quality of the image is very poor and I can only recognize the Tennessee flag and electric guitar \u2013 the latter referring to state playing a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music. Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues. It is also home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers.\u2026 Read more \n",

        "description": "\nThere were some fears that the new Been There series is just a hoax. Well, probably not, since I\u2019ve just discovered two new pics of the new collection. Even though these are of a very low quality it makes me believe these new mugs are real.\nAs we can see it really looks like hand drawn design, imagine it was a kid drawing it. I can tell you right away, the initial reaction of muggers is definitely not positive, but let\u2019s see what it looks like in real life, it\u2019s too early to judge.\u2026 Read more \n",
